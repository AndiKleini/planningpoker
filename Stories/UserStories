Technical depts:
Clean up database before each testrun so that the first test run after a debugging session doesn't fail.
Write warning when fwarnf is used with too many arguments.
Include concrete parameter checking in fwarnf mocks for unit tests
Launch pokerserver used for integration tests by unit test code instead of launching it by makefile.
Rename and merge bash scripts for test harness properly (testplanningserver.sh, testplanningserversession.sh -> testplanningserver)
Handle unknown command in handler.c (avoid get estimations as default command)
Refactor duplicate code (commands) in makefile.
Refactor duplicate code in storage.c
